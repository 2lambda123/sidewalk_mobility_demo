## A short description
This workspace contain the code for the following planned demos:
- Transportation group (June 29th, 2023)
- Kista Mobility Day (August 30th, 2023)
- ITRL Open House (August 31st, 2023)


The demos will be based on the work done during spring 2023 which includes 
- Federico Sacco's master thesis
- Kaj Munhoz Arfivdsson's infrastructure sensor
- ...?

### Outline 

1. SVEA will drive around a track.
2. People/Pedestrians will be detected around the track by an infrastructure sensor (ZED stereo vision camera).
3. Using Federico's Social Model Predictive Controller the SVEA will avoid pedestrians that stand in the way.
